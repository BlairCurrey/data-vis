This application is an extension of an application developed by the University of London. Some of the work is not my own. [Please see here for more details.](#more-details-on-attribution) 

## About
I used [the p5js library](https://p5js.org/) for visualizations and animation, with the exception of an SVG for the "Housing vs. Income by State."

## Visualizations
- Heatmap for sales metrics at a previous job
- Shot chart for Steph Curry, Demar Derozan, and DeAndre Jordan
- Animated line graph with speed controls and multiple data sets
- Interactive SVG of the United States, showing the median mortgage payment as a percentage of median income.
- Loading animation (unused, but *arguably* neat)

#### More Details on Attribution
These data visualizations are an extension of a school project. The gallery.js and sketch.js code was written entirely but by the University of London. helper-funtions.js and index.html were provided by the University of London in the original prompt but were expanded by myself. All the visualizations and animation are my original work.
